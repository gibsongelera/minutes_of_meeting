/**
 * Service-role Supabase client. Bypasses RLS entirely.
 *
 * Use only where there is no Supabase user session to act as — today that
 * means the ElevenLabs/AssemblyAI webhooks, which are called by a third
 * party with no cookies and no auth.uid(). Never use this in a request
 * handler that serves an authenticated user directly; use
 * @/lib/supabase/server for that so RLS stays the actual access boundary.
